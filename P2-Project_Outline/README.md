### Overview
Our project will be called "Plantopedia" and it will be a site in which users will be able to view, learn, and share information about their favorite house plants. Each and every plant will have important information such as scientific name, care facts, and pictures for our users to view. Plantopedia users will also be able to comment and view other users comments about any specific plant species they may be interested in. Certain users on our site will have the title of admin and will have the ability to remove any users or comments that they deem necessary. Our application will be used to unite plant lovers across the world while giving them access to a vast supply of knowledge that they will learn from.
### Features
* User Plant Management: Users will be able to view plants with the option of adding individual plants to a public or private folder.
* User Management & Authentication: Users can log in and will be assigned a role, with each role having specific privileges and views.
* Plant Wiki: Users will be able to view plant images and descriptions pulled from a third party API.
* Plant Forum: Users will be able to view posts, add posts, and interact with posts.
### Technologies
* Java
* Spring Boot
* MySQL
* Hibernate
* Thymeleaf templates
* Bootstrap
### What I'll Have to Learn
* How to integrate an API in a web application: we will need to find a public-facing API giving access to a database of plant data, then query that API according to user actions and display the results attractively in a web page.
* How to create different levels of user authority: we will need to create filters which distinguish between users not logged in, standard users logged in, and administrative users logged in. These users will have different access and privileges.
